# Monarrk's Dots
My dotfiles and other collections of scripts I use to make my computer feel more like home

**Disclaimer: Some parts of these may not be made by me.** (specifically speaking: vim scripts weren't created by me)

If you clone this and you don't see any files, remember that these are *dotfiles* and you need to run `ls -A` rather than simply `ls`
